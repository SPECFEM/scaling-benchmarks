Titan is a Cray XK7 system, containing 16-core AMD Opteron CPUs and NVIDIA Kepler K20x GPUs. Titan features 18,688 compute nodes.

Each compute node contains (1) 16-core 2.2GHz AMD Opteron 6274 (Interlagos) processor and (32) GB of RAM. 
Two nodes share (1) Gemini high-speed interconnect router. The resulting partition contains 299,008 traditional processor cores, and (598) TB of memory. 
In addition to the Opteron CPU, all of Titan 18,688 physical compute nodes contain (1) NVIDIA Kepler K20x accelerator (GPU) with 6 GB of DDR5 memory connected through a PCI express 2.0 interface.
