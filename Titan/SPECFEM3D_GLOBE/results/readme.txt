On plotting results:
- use log-log scale to show linear trend
- use either the "Estimated total run time" at 300 time steps or the "Total elapsed time" in output_solver.txt
  (depending if you want to include time spent on I/O to save seismograms)
- divide by 300 to have the "Average run time per time step (s)"
